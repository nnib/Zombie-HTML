		<b>AT <b>NEW WORLD HEALTH</b> (NWH) we offer a wide range of products.</b>
		</br></br>
		We have been working tirelessly to not only slow down the effects of Zombieism but to eradicate it completely.
		</br>		
		Scientific research (carried out here in our own laboratories) tell us that we can now treat people, who have been infected with the virus for weeks and bring them back to their normal self (for the most part) 
		which is a huge medical breakthrough as previously we could only help those infected within a two day period. 
		</br>
		We have a number of products/treatments available and are confident we can "bring you back" no matter how long you've been infected.
		</br>
		A number of our products can also help slow down the virus, meaning you can lead a somewhat normal life waiting for full treatment.
		</br>
		We also stock a number of survival kits for short or long term travel.
		</br>
		Please peruse our site for more information. We are sure you will find it helpful.
		</br>
		Do not hesitate to contact us if you need any further information. Our staff are here to help.

		<b>"Standards for National Health Information Sources in Ireland
We have published Draft Standards for National Health Information Resources and have undergone a consultation process to obtain feedback.  
These Draft Standards have been developed using a review of what is currently in place, input from an advisory group and a review of international practices. 
Feedback from the consultation will be used to create a final set of standards which will be presented to the Minister for Health for approval.  
Read the Statement of Outcomes Report on the outcome of the public consultation on the Draft Standards for National Health Information Resources."</b>
